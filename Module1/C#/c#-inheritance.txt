Inheritance in C#
=================
1.Inheritance is one of the OOP feature
2.Inheritance allows using one class functionaliteis in another class with out object creation
3.Inheritance provide code-reusabilty
Syntax:
class A(base class)
{
//functionaliteis
}
class B(derived class):A
{
//A functionaliteis we can you here directly
}
Note:In Inheritance Derived class(Class B) object can access all the public members of base class(Class A)

Types of Inheritance
====================
1.Single Inheritance
2.Multilevel Inheritance
3.Hirarichal Inheritance
4.Multiple Inheritance(not supported in c#)
5.Hybrid Inheritance(not supported by c#)

Polymorphism in C#
===================
It is the concept of defining multiple functions with the same name.
1.static Polymorphism(Compile time Polymorphism)
method overloading
2.dynamic Polymorphism(Run time Polymorphism)
In dynamic Polymorphism the intance of the class is decided at runtime.
method overriding

Method Overriding
================
Method Overriding is the concept of defining same function in base class and derived class
In Method Overriding the base class function is declaraed with virtual keyword.
and while implementing that funtion in derived class use the override keyword.
static methods can not be override.
Method overloading allows to extend or rewrite base functionality in derived class.
